# Science Fair project

In eighth grade I did a science fair project at the urging of my
school. My mentor (the splendid [Dr. Aaron
Bradley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-bradley314159/)) exhibited
admirable patience in guiding me through coding a [Boolean
satisfiability
solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem)
in Python, and then I used it to solve Sudoku puzzles. The alleged
experiment was to see if puzzles rated as harder would take longer to
solve via SAT. In this repository is the code, the results, and the
paper and poster that I wrote up. For historical interest only, as I
cannot imagine the implementation or analysis could have any actual
utility. You can see what I thought a scientific paper was supposed to
look like back in eighth grade, I suppose...
